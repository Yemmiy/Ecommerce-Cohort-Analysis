Cohort Analysis

This project explores cohort analysis to understand user behavior over time.  
A cohort is a group of users who share a common characteristic (such as the month they signed up), and cohort analysis helps reveal trends in retention, churn, and engagement.

 Features
- Load and clean raw user data
- Group users into cohorts based on signup date or first activity
- Calculate retention metrics across different cohorts
- Visualize cohort retention with tables and heatmaps
- Export results for further analysis
